This project analyzes electric vehicle trip data
------
Project Overview
----------------
This project analyzes electric vehicle trip data to predict estimate energy consumption. 
The data comes from RWTH Aachen University at this link (https://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/979878). The dataset contains 4 datasets.
I choose to work on the first dataset `trip_data`that contain information on trip characteristics such as speed, temperature, state of charge (SoC),
and other performance metrics across multiple fleet types.

The analysis involves:
- Loading and preprocessing `.parquet` trip data files.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA), including missing value visualization.
- Feature engineering, especially on energy metrics.
- Training and evaluating machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest).
- Visualizing feature importances and interpreting results.
